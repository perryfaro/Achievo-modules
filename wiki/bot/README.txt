DESCRIPTION

These files accompany my PHP bot-writing tutorial at http://wikisum.com/w/User:Adam/Creating_MediaWiki_bots_in_PHP, which you should read first.

BasicBot.php is the only file you really need. The others are demo bots, showing how to use BasicBot when developing your own bots. Be sure to set all the settings at the top of BasicBot.php.

You will also need to download Snoopy and put it in the same directory as BasicBot.php. See the tutorial for details.

LICENSE AND COPYRIGHT

You are welcome to use my code in any application that you want. However, please do not redistribute my code. Instead, refer people to my site if they want the code. Kind of like what I did with Snoopy. My code requires Snoopy, but I didn't include it; instead, I tell you where to go download it from. That's what you should do with my code. I figure that since I'm giving this away for free, the least you can do is send folks to my site so I have a chance of getting some advertising revenue :)

DISCLAIMERS

I don't guarantee anything about my code. I don't promise that it will work for any purpose or that it is secure. That's up to you to test on your own.

I don't support my code. You're smart; if something isn't quite right you can figure out how to fix it, I'm sure. I just don't have the time to answer support emails. Please don't register at wikisum.com if your sole purpose is posting a question on my talk page. However, I do appreciate having bugfixes emailed to me :)

That is all.
